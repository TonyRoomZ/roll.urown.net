    3DES

        `Triple DES (3DES) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DES>`_ is the common
        name for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA or Triple DEA)
        symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the Data Encryption Standard
        (DES) cipher algorithm three times to each data block. While in theory
        it has 168 bits of security, the practical security it provides is only
        112 bits. To make things worse, there are known attacks against it, so
        that effectively it compares to about 80 bits security.

    802.11
    IEEE 802.11

        `IEEE 802.11 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11>`_ is a set of
        :term:`Media Access Control` (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for
        implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) computer communication in the
        900 MHz and 2.4, 3.6, 5, and 60 GHz frequency bands. They are the world's most
        widely used wireless computer networking standards, used in most home and
        office networks to allow laptops, printers, and smartphones to talk to each
        other and access the Internet without connecting wires. They are created and
        maintained by the :term:`Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers`
        (IEEE) LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The base version of the
        standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard
        and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi
        brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in
        the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the
        revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a
        result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.

    802.11a
        TBD


    802.11ac
    IEEE 802.11ac

        `IEEE 802.11ac <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac>`_ is a wireless
        networking standard in the :term:`802.11` family (which is marketed under the
        brand name :term:`Wi-Fi`), developed in the :term:`IEEE` Standards
        Association, providing high-throughput wireless local area networks
        (:term:`WLAN`) on the 5 GHz band. The standard was developed from 2008
        through 2013 and published in December 2013.

        The specification has multi-station throughput of at least **1 Gbit/s** and
        single-link throughput of at least **500 Mbit/s**. This is accomplished by
        extending the air-interface concepts embraced by :term:`802.11n`: wider RF
        bandwidth (up to 160 MHz), more :term:`MIMO` spatial streams (up to eight),
        downlink multi-user MIMO (up to four clients), and high-density modulation (up
        to 256-:term:`QAM`).

        The first 802.11ac products from 2013 are referred to as **Wave 1**, and the
        newer higher bandwidth products introduced in 2016 are referred to as **Wave
        2**.


    802.11ax
    IEEE 802.11ax

        `IEEE 802.11ax <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ax>`_ is a type of
        WLAN in the :term:`IEEE 802.11` set of types of :term:`WLAN`. IEEE 802.11ax is
        designed to operate in the already existing 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrums. In
        addition to utilizing :term:`MIMO` and :term:`MU-MIMO`, the new amendment
        introduces :term:`OFDMA` to improve overall spectral efficiency, and higher
        order 1024 :term:`QAM` modulation support for increased throughput. Though the
        nominal data rate is just 37% higher than :term:`IEEE 802.11ac`, the new
        amendment is expected to achieve a 4x increase to user throughput—due to more
        efficient spectrum utilization.

        IEEE 802.11ax is due to be publicly released sometime in 2019. Devices were
        presented at CES 2018 that showed a top speed of **11 Gbps**.


    802.11b
    IEEE 802.11b

        `IEEE 802.11b-1999 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11b-1999>`_  or
        802.11b, is an amendment to the :term:`IEEE 802.11` wireless networking
        specification that extends throughput up to **11 Mbit/s** using the same
        2.4GHz band. A related amendment was incorporated into the IEEE  802.11-2007
        standard.


    802.11e
    IEEE 802.11e

        See also :term:`WMM`.

        `IEEE 802.11e-2005 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11e-2005>`_
        or 802.11e is an approved amendment to the :term:`IEEE 802.11` standard
        that defines a set of :term:`Quality of Service` (QoS) enhancements for
        wireless LAN applications through modifications to the :term:`Media
        Access  Control` (MAC) layer. The standard is considered of critical
        importance  for delay-sensitive applications, such as :term:`Voice over
        Wireless LAN` and streaming multimedia. The amendment has been
        incorporated into the  published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard.


    802.11g
    IEEE 802.11g

        `IEEE 802.11g-2003 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003>`_ or
        802.11g is an amendment to the :term:`IEEE 802.11` specification that extended
        throughput to up to **54 Mbit/s** using the same 2.4 GHz band as
        :term:`802.11b`. This specification under the marketing name of :term:`Wi-Fi`
        has been implemented all over the world. The 802.11g protocol is now Clause 19
        of the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard, and Clause 19 of the published
        IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.


    802.11n
    IEEE 802.11n

        `IEEE 802.11n-2009 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009>`_,
        commonly shortened to 802.11n, is a wireless-networking standard that
        uses multiple antennas to increase data rates. Sometimes referred to
        as MIMO, which stands for "multiple input and multiple output", it is
        an amendment to the IEEE 802.11-2007 wireless-networking standard. Its
        purpose is to improve network throughput over the two previous
        standards — :term:`802.11a` and :term:`802.11g` — with a significant
        increase in the maximum net data rate from 54 Mbit/s to **600 Mbit/s**
        (slightly higher gross bit rate including for example error-correction
        codes, and slightly lower maximum throughput) with the use of four
        spatial streams at a channel width of 40 MHz. 802.11n standardized
        support for multiple-input multiple-output, frame aggregation, and
        security improvements, among other features. It can be used in the 2.4
        GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands.

        Development of 802.11n began in 2002, seven years before publication.
        The 802.11n protocol is now Clause 20 of the published IEEE
        :term:`802.11`-2012 standard.


    802.11w
    Management Frame Protection
    MFP

        `IEEE 802.11w-2009 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11w-2009>`_ is an
        approved amendment to the :term:`IEEE 802.11` standard to increase the
        security of its management frames.

    ACME
    Automated Certificate Management Environment
        The
        `Automatic Certificate Management Environment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment#API_version_2>`_
        (ACME) protocol is a communications protocol for automating interactions
        between certificate authorities and their users' web servers, allowing
        the automated deployment of public key infrastructure at very low
        cost. It was designed by the Internet Security Research Group
        (ISRG) for their Let's Encrypt service.

        The protocol, based on passing JSON-formatted messages over HTTPS, has
        been published as an Internet Standard in :rfc:`8555` by its own
        chartered :term:`IETF` working group.


    AES
    Advanced Encryption Standard

        `The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard>`_ is a is a
        symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data
        established by a U.S. Governement institution (:term:`NIST`) in 2001.
        AES has been adopted by the U.S. government for top secret information
        and is used worldwide today. It supersedes the
        :term:`Data Encryption Standard` (DES).


    AES-NI
    Advanced Encryption Standard Instruction Set

        `Advanced Encryption Standard Instruction Set (or AES-NI)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set>`_ is an extension of
        the x86 CPU architecture from Intel and AMD. It accelarates data
        encryption and decryption if the :term:`Advanced Encryption Standard`
        (AES) is used by an application.


    AMD Platform Security Processor
    AMD PSP
    AMD Secure Technology
    PSP

        The `AMD Platform Security Processor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Platform_Security_Processor>`_
        (PSP), officially known as AMD Secure Technology, is a trusted
        execution environment subsystem incorporated **since about 2013** into
        all AMD microprocessors. According to an AMD developer's guide, the
        subsystem is "responsible for creating, monitoring and maintaining the
        security environment" and "its functions include managing the boot
        process, initializing various security related mechanisms, and
        monitoring the system for any suspicious activity or events and
        implementing an appropriate response." Critics worry it can be used as
        a backdoor and is a security concern.

        AMD has denied requests to open source the code that runs on the PSP.

        The PSP is similar to the :term:`Intel Management Engine` for Intel
        processors.


    Authenticated Received Chain
    ARC

        `Authenticated Received Chain <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_Received_Chain>`_

        (ARC) is an email authentication system designed to allow an
        intermediate mail server like a mailing list or forwarding service to
        sign an email's original authentication results. This allows a receiving
        service to validate an email when the email's :term:`SPF` and
        :term:`DKIM` records are rendered invalid by an intermediate server's
        processing.

        ARC is currently an Internet Draft with the IETF.

        :term:`DMARC` allows a sender's domain to indicate that their emails are
        protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells a receiving service what to do
        if neither of those authentication methods passes - such as to reject
        the message. However, a strict DMARC policy may block legitimate emails
        sent through a mailing list or forwarder, as the SPF check will fail due
        to the unapproved sender, and the DKIM signature will be invalidated if
        the message is modified, such as by adding a subject tag or footer.

        ARC helps solve this problem by giving intermediate servers a way to
        sign the original message's validation results. Even if the SPF and DKIM
        validation fail, the receiving service can choose to validate the ARC.
        If the ARC indicates that the original message passed the SPF and DKIM
        checks, and the only modifications were made by intermediaries trusted
        by the receiving service, the receiving service may choose to accept the
        email.


    AXFR
    DNS zone transfer

        `DNS zone transfer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone_transfer>`_,
        also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type AXFR, is a type of
        DNS transaction. A zone transfer uses TCP for transport, and takes the
        form of a client–server transaction. The client requesting a zone
        transfer may be a slave server or secondary server, requesting data from
        a master server, sometimes called a primary server. The portion of the
        database that is replicated is a zone. Avoid if possible and use other
        more secure replication methods. See also `What are zone transfers?
        <https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tcp.html#intro-axfr>`_ from Daniel Bernstein.


    Bayesian Filter
    Bayesian Filtering
    Bayesian Spam Filter

        A `Bayesian spam filter
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_spam_filtering>`_ (after Rev.
        Thomas Bayes) is a statistical technique of e-mail filtering. In its
        basic form, it makes use of a naive Bayes classifier on bag of words
        features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text
        classification.


    Beacon Broadcast interval
    Beacon Interval
        Beacon Broadcast interval is the time lag between each of the beacons
        sent by your router or access points. By definition, the lower the
        value, the smaller the time lag which means that the beacon is sent more
        frequently. The higher the value, the bigger the time lag which means
        that the beacon is sent broadcasted less frequently.

        The beacon is needed for your devices or clients to receive information
        about the particular router. In this case the beacon includes some main
        information such as SSID, Timestamp, and various parameters.

        See `Beacon Interval Best Optimal Setting <https://routerguide.net/beacon-interval-best-optimal-setting-improve-wireless-speed/>`_


    Blowfish
        `Blowfish <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)>`_ is a
        symmetric-key block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and
        included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products.
        Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective
        cryptanalysis of it has been found to date. However, the :term:`Advanced
        Encryption Standard` (:term:`AES`) now receives more attention. Blowfish
        users are encouraged by Bruce Schneier, Blowfish's creator, to use the
        more modern and computationally efficient alternative :term:`Twofish`.


    BSSID
    Basic Service Set Identifier
        An infrastructure mode wireless network consists of one ore more
        redistribution points — typically access points — together with one or
        more "client" stations that are associated with (i.e. connected to) that
        redistribution point.

        Each access point has its own unique identifier, a BSSID, which is a
        unique 48-bit identifier that follows :term:`MAC Address` conventions
        and is usually non-configurable.

    CCM mode Protocol
    CCMP
    Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol
    Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol
        `CCMP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCMP_(cryptography)>`_ is an
        encryption protocol designed for Wireless LAN products that implements
        the standards of the :term:`IEEE 802.11i` amendment to the original
        :term:`IEEE 802.11` standard. CCMP is an enhanced data cryptographic
        encapsulation mechanism designed for data confidentiality and based upon
        the Counter Mode with CBC-MAC (CCM mode) of the :term:`Advanced
        Encryption Standard` (AES) standard. It was created to address the
        vulnerabilities presented by :term:`Wired Equivalent Privacy` (WEP), a
        dated, insecure protocol.

        CCMP is the standard encryption protocol for use with the :term:`Wi-Fi
        Protected Access II` (WPA2) standard and is much more secure than the
        Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol and :term:`Temporal Key
        Integrity Protocol` (TKIP) of :term:`Wi-Fi Protected Access` (WPA).


    Chip card
    ICC
    Integrated Circuit Card
    Smart card
    Smartcard

        A pocket-sized plastic card with embedded integrated circuits. Smart
        cards can provide identification, authentication, data storage and
        application processing. See the `Wikipedia article
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card>`_ for many possible usage
        scenarios.


    Cipher Suite
        A cipher suite is a standardized collection of key exchange algorithms,
        encryption algorithms (ciphers) and Message authentication codes
        (:term:`MAC`) algorithm that provides authenticated encryption schemes.
        For more information see [KAea14b]_.


    Composer

        `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_ is a tool for dependency management in
        PHP. It allows a developer to declare the dependent libraries a project needs
        and it will install them along the project.


    Cryptographic Hash Function

        A `cryptographic hash function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function>`_
        is a :term:`Hash Function` which is considered practically impossible to
        invert, that is, to recreate the input data from its hash value alone.
        They are used for digital signatures, Message Authentication Codes
        (:term:`MAC`), and other forms of authentication. It can also be used as
        ordinary hash function, to index data in hash tables, for
        fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and
        as checksums to detect accidental data corruption. Cryptographic hash
        values are sometimes called (digital) fingerprints, checksums, or just
        hash values. Some widely used ones are: :term:`MD5`, :term:`SHA-1`,
        :term:`SHA-256`


    Curve25519

        In cryptography, `Curve25519 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519>`_ is
        an elliptic curve offering 128 bits of security and designed for use with the
        :term:`Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman` (:term:`ECDH`) key agreement scheme. It
        is one of the fastest :term:`ECC` curves and is not covered by any known
        patents. Curve25519 was first released by Daniel J. Bernstein in 2005, but
        interest increased considerably after 2013 when it was discovered that the NSA
        had implemented a backdoor into :term:`Dual EC DRBG`. While not directly
        related, suspicious aspects of the :term:`NIST P curves` led to concerns that
        the NSA had chosen values that gave them an advantage in factoring public
        keys.


    Daemon

        Long-running programs usually running in the background and providing
        services for other programs and or clients on other systems connected by
        a network. Daemons typically are started automatically on system boot
        and run on their own, without any user interaction.


    DANE
    DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities

        `DNS based Authentication of Named Entities <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities>`_
        (DANE) is a protocol to allow :term:`X.509` certificates, commonly used for
        :term:`Transport Layer Security` (:term:`TLS`), to be bound to :term:`DNS`
        names using :term:`Domain Name System Security Extensions` (:term:`DNSSEC`).
        It is proposed in :RFC:`6698` as a way to authenticate TLS client and server
        entities without a :term:`Certificate Authority` (CA).


    Data deduplication

        In computing,
        `data deduplication <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication>`_
        is a technique for eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data.
        Thereby dramatically reducing the required storage space. It can also be
        applied to network data transfers to reduce the number of bytes that
        must be transferred.

        The deduplication process cuts the data to be stored into equal sized
        'chunks'. These chunks are then compared to other chunks already stored
        earlier. Whenever a match occurs, the new chunk is replaced with a small
        reference that points to the already stored chunk, instead of storing it
        again. Given that the same byte pattern may occur dozens, hundreds, or
        even thousands of times (depending on the used chunk size), the amount
        of data that must be stored or transferred can be greatly reduced.

    DES
    Data Encryption Standard

        The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a previously predominant symmetric-key
        algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. It is now considered to be
        insecure. This is chiefly due to the 56-bit key size being too small; in
        January, 1999, distributed.net and the :term:`Electronic Frontier Foundation`
        collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes. The
        cipher has been superseded by the :term:`Advanced Encryption Standard` (AES)
        and has been withdrawn as a standard. DES was developed in the early 1970s at
        IBM. **Do not use!**


    DH
    Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

        `Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Hellman_key_exchange>`_
        is a specific method of exchanging cryptographic keys.
        The method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to
        jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel.
        This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a
        symmetric key cipher. Youtube has a `great video
        <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QnD2c4Xovk>`_ that explains it in 5 minutes.


    DH Parameters
        DH parameters are pre-generated large prime-numbers, which accelerates
        the  generatation of session keys while using :term:`Diffie-Hellman Key
        Exchange`. To find and evaluate such prime numbers takes a long time
        (up to several minutes). Using pre-generated values allows to establish
        session keys during initial handshake and periodic renevals, without any
        noticeable delay.

    Diceware
        `Diceware <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware>`_ is a method for
        creating passphrases, passwords, and other cryptographic variables using
        ordinary dice as a hardware random number generator. For each word in
        the passphrase, five rolls of the dice are required. The numbers from 1
        to 6 that come up in the rolls are assembled as a five-digit number,
        e.g. 43146. That number is then used to look up a word in a word list.
        In the English list 43146 corresponds to munch. By generating several
        words in sequence, a lengthy passphrase can be constructed.

        A Diceware word list is any list of 6^5 = 7,776 unique words, preferably
        ones the user will find easy to spell and to remember. The contents of
        the word list do not have to be protected or concealed in any way, as
        the security of a Diceware passphrase is in the number of words
        selected, and the number of words each selected word could be taken
        from. Lists have been compiled for several languages.

    Distance Optimization
        A configuration option in wireless networks. The distance between the
        wireless access point and the furthest wireless client in meters.


    DKIM
    DomainKeys Identified Mail

        `DomainKeys Identified Mail <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail>`_
        (DKIM) is an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender
        addresses in emails (email spoofing), a technique often used in phishing
        and email spam.

        DKIM allows the receiver to check that an email claimed to have come
        from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that
        domain. It achieves this by affixing a digital signature, linked to a
        domain name, to each outgoing email message. The recipient system can
        verify this by looking up the sender's public key published in the DNS.
        A valid signature also guarantees that some parts of the email (possibly
        including attachments) have not been modified since the signature was
        affixed. Usually, DKIM signatures are not visible to end-users, and are
        affixed or verified by the infrastructure rather than the message's
        authors and recipients.

        DKIM is now an "Internet standard". It is defined in :rfc:`6376`, dated
        September 2011; with updates in :rfc:`8301` and :rfc:`8463`.


    DMARC
    Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance

        `DMARC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC>`_ (Domain-based Message
        Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) is an email authentication
        protocol. It is designed to give email domain owners the ability to
        protect their domain from unauthorized use, commonly known as email
        spoofing. The purpose and primary outcome of implementing DMARC is to
        protect a domain from being used in business email compromise attacks,
        phishing emails, email scams and other cyber threat activities.

        Once the DMARC DNS entry is published, any receiving email server can
        authenticate the incoming email based on the instructions published by
        the domain owner within the DNS entry. If the email passes the
        authentication it will be delivered and can be trusted. If the email
        fails the check, depending on the instructions held within the DMARC
        record the email could be delivered, quarantined or rejected.

        DMARC extends two existing mechanisms, :term:`Sender Policy Framework`
        (SPF) and :term:`DomainKeys Identified Mail` (DKIM). It allows the
        administrative owner of a domain to publish a policy in their DNS
        records to specify which mechanism (DKIM, SPF or both) is employed when
        sending email from that domain; how to check the From: field presented
        to end users; how the receiver should deal with failures - and a
        reporting mechanism for actions performed under those policies.

        DMARC is defined in :rfc:`7489`, dated March 2015, as "Informational".


    DNS
    Domain Name System
        TBD


    DNS Resolver

        The client side of the DNS is called a DNS resolver. A resolver is
        responsible for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately
        lead to a full resolution (translation) of the resource sought, e.g.,
        translation of a domain name into an IP address. DNS resolvers are
        classified by a variety of query methods, such as recursive,
        non-recursive, and iterative. A resolution process may use a combination
        of these methods.


    DNS-over-HTTPS
    DoH

        `DNS over HTTPS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS>`_ (DoH)
        is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (:term:`DNS`)
        resolution via the :term:`HTTPS` protocol. A goal of the method is to
        increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and
        manipulation of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks[1] by using the
        HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data between the DoH client and the
        DoH-based DNS resolver. By March of 2018, Google and the Mozilla
        Foundation had started testing versions of DNS over HTTPS. In February
        2020, Firefox switched to DNS over HTTPS by default for users in the
        United States.

    DNS-over-TLS
    DoT

        `DNS over TLS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS>`_ (DoT) is a
        security protocol for encrypting and wrapping Domain Name System
        (:term:`DNS`) queries and answers via the
        :term:`Transport Layer Security` (:term:`TLS`) protocol. The goal of the
        method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing
        eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via man-in-the-middle
        attacks.

    DNSCrypt

        `DNSCrypt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSCrypt>`_ is a network
        protocol that authenticates and encrypts :term:`Domain Name
        System` (term:`DNS`) traffic between the user's computer and recursive
        name servers. It was originally designed by Frank Denis and Yecheng Fu.
        Although multiple client and server implementations exist, the protocol
        was never proposed to the :term:`Internet Engineering Task Force`
        (:term:`IETF`) by the way of a :term:`Request for Comments`
        (:term:`RFC`). DNSCrypt wraps unmodified DNS traffic between a client
        and a DNS resolver in a cryptographic construction in order to detect
        forgery. Though it doesn't provide end-to-end security, it protects the
        local network against man-in-the-middle attacks. It also mitigates
        UDP-based amplification attacks by requiring a question to be at least
        as large as the corresponding response. Thus, DNSCrypt helps to prevent
        DNS amplification attacks.

    DNSSEC
    Domain Name System Security Extensions

        The `Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions>`_ is a
        suite of :term:`Internet Engineering Task Force` (:term:`IETF`) specifications
        for securing certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System
        (DNS) as used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It is a set of extensions to
        DNS which provide to DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS
        data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not
        availability or confidentiality.


    DSA
    Digital Signature Algorithm

        `The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm>`_
        is a United States Federal Information Processing Standard for digital
        signatures. In August 1991 the :term:`National Institute of Standards
        and Technology` (NIST) proposed DSA for use in their
        :term:`Digital Signature Standard` (:term:`DSS`) and adopted it 1994 in
        its :term:`FIPS` standards specification. Four revisions to the initial
        specification have been released in 1996, 2000, 2009 and in 2013.

        DSA is covered by a U.S. Patent and attributed to a former NSA
        employee. The patent was given to the United States, and NIST has made
        it available worldwide royalty-free. DSA is a variant of the ElGamal
        signature scheme.

    Digital Signature Standard
    DSS

        The
        `Digital Signature Standard (DSS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Standard>`_
        is a United States Federal Information Processing Standard specifying a
        suite of algorithms that can be used to generate digital signatures
        established by the :term:`National Institute of Standards and Technology`
        (NIST) in 1994. Four revisions to the initial specification have been
        released: :term:`FIPS` 186-1 in 1996, FIPS 186-2 in 2000, FIPS 186-3 in
        2009, and FIPS 186-4 in 2013.

        It defines the :term:`Digital Signature Algorithm` (DSA), contains a
        definition of :term:`RSA` signatures based on the definitions contained
        within :term:`PKCS #1` version 2.1 and in American National Standard
        X9.31 with some additional requirements, and contains a definition of
        the :term:`Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm` based on the
        definition provided by American National Standard X9.62 with some
        additional requirements and some recommended elliptic curves. It also
        approves the use of all three algorithms.

    DTIM Interval
    Delivery traffic indication map
    Delivery traffic indication message
        DTIM stands for Delivery traffic indication map or message. It is
        basically an additional message added after the normal beacon broadcast
        by your router or access point. See :term:`Beacon Interval`.

        Depending on the timing set for your router, the router “buffers”
        broadcast and multicast data and let your mobile devices or clients know
        when to “wake up” to receive those data.

        The more often that DTIM is transmitted, the more often that your mobile
        devices wake up, and the more battery that it uses (due to the lack of
        “sleep”). By setting a low value of DTIM and beacon interval, you can
        effectively keep your devices awake indefinitely so they never go into
        sleep mode when idling. In some cases the “no sleep” setup can use up to
        10~20% additional power consumption.

        See `DTIM Interval Best Setting <https://routerguide.net/dtim-interval-period-best-setting/>`_


    Dual EC DRBG
    Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator

        Dual EC DRBG (Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator) is
        an algorithm that was presented as a cryptographically secure
        pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) using methods in :term:`Elliptic
        Curve Cryptography`. Despite wide public criticism, including a
        potential backdoor, for seven years it was one of the four (now three)
        CSPRNGs standardized in NIST SP 800-90A as originally published circa
        June 2006, until *withdrawn in 2014*.


    ECC
    Elliptic Curve Cryptography
    Elliptic-Curve Cryptography

        `Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography>`_ is an
        approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of
        elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC requires smaller keys compared
        to non-ECC cryptography (based on plain Galois fields) to provide
        equivalent security.[1]


    ECDH
    Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman
    Elliptic-Curve Diffie–Hellman

        `Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie-Hellman>`_ is an
        anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an
        Elliptic Curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret
        over an insecure channel. This shared secret may be directly  used as a
        key, or better yet, to derive another key which can then be used to
        encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher. It is a
        variant of the :term:`Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange` using :term:`Elliptic
        Curve Cryptography`.


    ECDSA
    Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

        In cryptography, the
        `Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm>`_
        offers a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (:term:`DSA`)
        which uses :term:`Elliptic Curve Cryptography`.


    Ed25519
    EdDSA

        In public-key cryptography, `Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm
        (EdDSA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA>`_ is a digital signature
        scheme using a variant of Schnorr signature based on Twisted Edwards
        curves. It is designed to be faster than existing digital signature
        schemes without sacrificing security. It was developed by a team
        including Daniel J. Bernstein, Niels Duif, Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe,
        and Bo-Yin Yang. The reference implementation is public domain software.


    EEPROM
    Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory
        `EEPROM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM>`_ (also E2PROM) stands
        for electrically erasable programmable read-only memory and is a type of
        non-volatile memory used in computers, integrated in microcontrollers
        for smart cards and remote keyless systems, and other electronic devices
        to store relatively small amounts of data but allowing individual bytes
        to be erased and reprogrammed.

    EFF
    Electronic Frontier Foundation
        `The Electronic Frontier Foundation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation>`_
        (EFF) is an international non-profit digital rights group based in San
        Francisco, California. The foundation was formed in July 1990 by John
        Gilmore, John Perry Barlow and Mitch Kapor to promote Internet civil
        liberties.

    EPROM
    Erasable Programmable Read-only Memory
        An `EPROM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPROM>`_ (rarely EROM), or
        erasable programmable Read-Only Memory, is a type of programmable
        :term:`Read-Only Memory` (PROM) chip that retains its data when its
        power supply is switched off. Computer memory that can retrieve stored
        data after a power supply has been turned off and back on is called
        non-volatile. It is an array of floating-gate transistors individually
        programmed by an electronic device that supplies higher voltages than
        those normally used in digital circuits. Once programmed, an EPROM can
        be erased by exposing it to strong ultraviolet light source (such as
        from a mercury-vapor lamp). EPROMs are easily recognizable by the
        transparent fused quartz window in the top of the package, through which
        the silicon chip is visible, and which permits exposure to ultraviolet
        light during erasing.


    ESMTP

        `Extended SMTP (ESTMP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_SMTP>`_
        includes additions made to :term:`SMTP` who where defined in 2008 in
        :rfc:`5321`. It is in widespread use today. Like SMTP, ESMTP uses TCP
        port 25.


    Filter Bubble
        A `filter bubble <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble>`_ is a
        result of a personalized search in which a website algorithm selectively
        guesses what information a user would like to see based on information
        about the user (such as location, past click behavior and search
        history) and, as a result, users become separated from information that
        disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own
        cultural or ideological bubbles. The term was coined by internet
        activist Eli Pariser in his book by the same name [ARNea]_. The bubble
        effect may have negative implications for civic discourse, according to
        Pariser, but there are contrasting views suggesting the effect is
        minimal and addressable.


    FIPS
        `Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards>`_
        are publicly announced standards developed by the US Government trough
        its National Institute of Standards and Technology (:term:`NIST`) for
        use in computer systems by non-military government agencies and
        government contractors.

        FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various
        purposes such as ensuring computer security and interoperability, and
        are intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not
        already exist. Many FIPS specifications are modified versions of
        standards used in the technical communities, such as the American
        National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and
        Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the International Organization for
        Standardization (ISO).

        These include amongst others, encryption standards, such as the
        Digital Signature Algorithm (:term:`DSA`), Data Encryption Standard
        (:term:`DES`) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (:term:`AES`).


    Firmware
        `Firmware <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware>`_ is essentially
        software that is very closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to
        need frequent updates. Typically stored in non-volatile memory chips
        such as :term:`ROM`, EPROM, or flash memory. Since it can only be
        updated or replaced by special procdures designed by the hardware
        manufacturer, it is somewhat on the boundary between *hardware* and
        *software*; thus the name *"firmware"*.


    Forward Secrecy
    FS
    Perfect Forward Secrecy
    PFS

        In cryptography, forward secrecy is a property of key-agreement
        protocols ensuring that a session key derived from a set of long-term
        keys cannot be compromised if one of the long-term keys (like the
        servers private key) is compromised in the future. Usually either
        :term:`Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange` or :term:`Elliptic Curve
        Diffie–Hellman` are used to create and exchange session keys.


    Fragmentation Threshold
        In wireless networks this value is used to set the maximum size of
        packet a client can send. Smaller packets improve reliability, but they
        will decrease performance. Unless you’re facing problems with an
        unreliable network, reducing the fragmentation threshold is not
        recommended. Make sure it is set to the default settings (usually 2346).

    Hash
    Hash Function
    Hash Functions
        A `hash function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function>`_ is any
        function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size onto data of a
        fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash
        values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. Hash functions are often
        used in combination with a hash table, a common data structure used in
        computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table
        or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file. One
        such application is finding similar stretches in DNA sequences. They are
        also useful in cryptography. A :term:`Cryptographic Hash Function`
        allows one to easily verify whether some input data map onto a given
        hash value, but if the input data is unknown it is deliberately
        difficult to reconstruct it (or any equivalent alternatives) by knowing
        the stored hash value. This is used for assuring integrity of
        transmitted data, and is the building block for :term:`HMAC`'s, which
        provide message authentication.

        Hash functions are related to (and often confused with) checksums, check
        digits, fingerprints, lossy compression, randomization functions,
        error-correcting codes, and ciphers. Although the concepts overlap to some
        extent, each one has its own uses and requirements and is designed and
        optimized differently.


    HMAC

        In cryptography, an `HMAC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC>`_
        (sometimes expanded as either keyed-hash message authentication code or
        hash-based message authentication code) is a specific type of
        :term:`Message Authentication Code` (:term:`MAC`) involving a
        :term:`Cryptographic Hash Function` and a secret cryptographic key. It
        may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the
        authentication of a message, as with any MAC. Any cryptographic hash
        function, such as :term:`SHA-256` or :term:`SHA-3`, may be used in the
        calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-X,
        where X is the hash function used (e.g. HMAC-SHA256 or HMAC-SHA3). The
        cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic
        strength of the underlying hash function, the size of its hash output,
        and the size and quality of the key.


    HTTP
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol
        `The Hypertext Transfer Protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol>`_
        (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative,
        hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data
        communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include
        hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for
        example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

        Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.
        Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) was a coordinated
        effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide
        Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.

    HTTPS
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
        `Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS>`_
        (HTTPS) is an extension of the :term:`Hypertext Transfer Protocol`
        (:term:`HTTP`). It is used for secure communication over a computer
        network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication
        protocol is encrypted using :term:`Transport Layer Security`
        (:term:`TLS`) or, formerly, :term:`Secure Sockets Layer` (:term:`SSL`).
        The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP
        over SSL.

    HPKP
    HTTP Public Key Pinning

        `HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning>`_ is a security
        mechanism introduced in 2015 with :rfc:`7469` delivered via an HTTP
        header which allows HTTPS websites to resist impersonation by attackers
        using mis-issued or otherwise fraudulent certificates. In order to do so,
        it delivers a set of public keys to the client (browser), which should
        be the only ones trusted for connections to this domain. In practice it
        was newer largely adopted. For website owners and is difficult and risky
        to maintain. Therefore Google
        `announced <https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/he9tr7p3rZ8/eNMwKPmUBAAJ?hn>`_
        in October 2017 to deprecate and later remove the HPKP feature from the
        Chrome browser.

        The `IETF <https://ietf.org/about/>`_ is a large open international community
        of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the
        evolution of the Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the
        Internet. The technical work of the IETF is done in Working Groups, which are
        organized by topic into several Areas.

        These working groups develop and promote the voluntary Internet standards, in
        particular the standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).
        These are typically published as :term:`RFC`. It is an open standards
        organization, with no formal membership or membership requirements. All
        participants and managers are volunteers, though their work is usually funded
        by their employers or sponsors.

        The IETF started out as an activity supported by the U.S. federal government,
        but since 1993 it has operated as a standards development function under the
        auspices of the Internet Society, an international membership-based non-profit
        organization.


    Intel Active Management Technology
    AMT

        `Intel Active Management Technology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology>`_
        (AMT) is hardware and firmware backdoor for remote out-of-band
        management of personal computers, running on the :term:`Intel
        Management Engine`, a separate microprocessor not exposed to the user,
        in order to monitor, maintain, update, upgrade, and repair them.

        Features include remote power up/down, boot from remote storage
        devices, console redirection, remote KVM access and other remote
        management and security features.

        Intel AMT is available on processors advertised under the umbrella
        marketing term **Intel vPro** technology tipically targeted at
        corporate customers since about 2007.

        Unlike the Intel Management Engine, AMT usually can be switched off by
        the computers BIOS options.


    Intel Management Engine
    ME
    Manageability Engine

        The `Intel Management Engine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine>`_
        (ME), also known as the Manageability Engine, is an autonomous
        subsystem that has been incorporated in virtually all of Intel's
        processor chipsets **since 2008**. It is located in the Platform
        Controller Hub of modern Intel motherboards. It is a part of
        :term:`Intel Active Management Technology`, which allows system
        administrators to perform tasks on the machine remotely. System
        administrators can use it to turn the computer on and off, and they can
        login remotely into the computer regardless of whether or not an
        operating system is installed.

        The Intel Management Engine always runs as long as the motherboard is
        receiving power, even when the computer is turned off.

        The ME is an attractive target for hackers, since it has top level
        access to all devices and completely bypasses the operating system.
        Intel has not released much information on the Intel Management
        Engine, prompting speculation that it may include a backdoor. The
        :term:`Electronic Frontier Foundation` has voiced concern about IME.

        AMD processors have a similar feature, called :term:`AMD Secure Technology`.


    IMAP
        `Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imap>`_ is a protocol for email
        retrieval and storage by the :term:`MUA` from the :term:`MAS`. It was
        devloped as an alternative to :term:`POP`. IMAP unlike :term:`POP`,
        specifically allows multiple clients simultaneously connected to the
        same mailbox, and through flags stored on the server, different clients
        accessing the same mailbox at the same or different times can detect
        state changes made by other clients. The IMAP protocol uses TCP port 143
        and TCP port 993 for :term:`SSL` secured IMAPS connections.

        TBD

    Jabber
        See :term:`XMPP`.


    KSK
    Key-signing-key
    DNSKEY

        Key-signing-key (KSK) is the cryptographic key-pair used in :term:`DNSSEC` to
        sign :term:`Zone-Signing-Keys` (ZSK). The KSK public key is signed by the
        parent and published as :term:`Delegation-Signing` (DS) record in the the
        parent zone. The child zone publishes the public part of the KSK as DNSKEY
        record in its own Zone.


    LACP
    Link Aggregation Control Protocol
        `Link Aggregation Control Protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation#Link_Aggregation_Control_Protocol>`_


    LDA
    Local Delivery Agent
        The software program in charge of delivering mail messages to its final
        destination on the local system, usually a users mailbox, after they
        receive a message from the :term:`MTA`.

    LDAP
        TBD.

    LMTP
        The `Local Mail Transfer Protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMTP>`_
        is a derivative of ESMTP, the extension of the Simple Mail Transfer
        Protocol. It is defined in :RFC:`2033`.


    LFU
        LFU means "Least Frequently Used"


    LRU

        LRU means "Least Recently Used"

    LUA

        `Lua <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)>`_ (from
        Portuguese meaning "moon") is a lightweight, multi-paradigm programming
        language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. Lua is
        cross-platform, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in
        ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into
        applications.

        Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software
        applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the
        time. It provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming
        languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not
        included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language,
        allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to
        be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused
        on improving its speed, portability, extensibility, and ease-of-use in
        development.



    MAC Address
    Media Access Control
    Media Access Control Address
        A `media access control address <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address>`_
        (MAC address) of a device is a unique identifier assigned to a network
        interface controller (NIC). For communications within a network segment,
        it is used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies,
        including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Within the Open Systems
        Interconnection (OSI) model, MAC addresses are used in the medium access
        control protocol sublayer of the data link layer. As typically
        represented, MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two
        hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or no separator (see
        Notational conventions below).

        A MAC address may be referred to as the burned-in address, and is also
        known as an **Ethernet hardware address**, **hardware address**, and
        **physical address**.

        A network node with multiple NICs must have a unique MAC address for
        each. Sophisticated network equipment such as a multilayer switch or
        router may require one or more permanently assigned MAC addresses.

        MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of network
        interface cards. Each is stored in hardware, such as the card's
        read-only memory or by a firmware mechanism. A MAC address typically
        includes the manufacturer's organizationally unique identifier (OUI).

    Memcached
    Memcache

        `Memcached <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached>`_ is a
        general-purpose distributed memory caching system. It is often used to
        speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in
        RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a
        database or API) must be read. Memcached is free and open-source
        software, licensed under the Revised BSD license. Memcached runs on
        Unix-like operating systems and on Microsoft Windows.

        Memcached's APIs provide a very large hash table distributed across
        multiple machines. When the table is full, subsequent inserts cause
        older data to be purged in least recently used (LRU) order. Applications
        using Memcached typically layer requests and additions into RAM before
        falling back on a slower backing store, such as a database.


    Milter

        `Milter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milter>`_ (portmanteau for mail
        filter) is an extension to the widely used open source mail transfer
        agents (:term:`MTA`) Sendmail and Postfix. It allows administrators to
        add mail filters for filtering spam or viruses in the mail-processing
        chain. In the language of the art, "milter" refers to the protocol and
        API implementing the service, while "a milter" has come to refer to a
        filter application that uses milter to provide service.


    MIMO
        TBD


    MSA
    Message Submission Agent
        The software program in charge of receiving mail messages from the
        :term:`MUA` using the :term:`Submission` protocol. The MSA runs as a
        :term:`Daemon`.


    MTA
    Mail Transfer Agent
        TBD


    MTA-STS
        SMTP Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) is a
        mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare their ability to
        receive Transport Layer Security (:term:`TLS`) secure :term:`SMTP`
        connections, and to specify whether sending SMTP servers should refuse
        to deliver to MX hosts that do not offer TLS with a trusted server
        certificate.


    MU-MIMO
        TBD


    MUA
    Message User Agent
        The software program in charge of retrieving messages from a users
        mailbox on a :term:`MAS` or :term:`Mail Access Server`, usually using
        either :term:`IMAP` or :term:`POP3` protocols. The MUA might also submit
        mail messages to the :term:`MSA` or :term:`Message Submission Agent`
        using the :term:`Submission` protocol. MUAs are commonly known as mail
        clients. Known MUA software product examples are Microsoft Outlook or
        Mozilla Thunderbird.


    MX
        DNS record for "Mail Exchanger", informing the sending system, which
        hosts are responsible to receive mails for a domain over :term:`SMTP`.


    NIST
    National Institute of Standards and Technology
        The `National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology>`_
        is a measurement standards laboratory, and a non-regulatory agency of
        the United States Department of Commerce. Its mission is to promote
        innovation and industrial competitiveness. In 2013 the newspapers
        Guardian and New York Times reported that NIST allowed the
        :term:`National Security Agency` (:term:`NSA`) to insert a
        cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator called
        :term:`Dual EC DRBG` into NIST standard SP 800-90 that had a
        kleptographic backdoor that the NSA can use to covertly predict the
        future outputs of this pseudorandom number generator thereby allowing
        the surreptitious decryption of data.

        According to Bernstein and Lange, many of the efficiency-related
        decisions in NIST FIPS 186-2 are sub-optimal. Other curves are more
        secure and run just as fast

        In 2014 `Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange claimed <https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/>`_
        that that most real-world implementations of :term:`Elliptic-Curve Cryptography`
        are not to be considered safe. Amongst many others they also criticize

    NTP
    Network Time Protocol

        `Network Time Protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol>`_
        (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer
        systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation
        since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use.

        NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few
        milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It is designed to mitigate
        the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to
        within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better
        than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions.
        Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or more.


    Null Modem

        `Null modem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_modem>`_ is a
        communication method to directly connect two DTEs (computer, terminal,
        printer, etc.) using an :term:`RS-232` serial cable. The name stems
        from the historical use of RS-232 cables to connect two teleprinter
        devices or two modems in order to communicate with one another; null
        modem communication refers to using a crossed-over RS-232 cable to
        connect the teleprinters directly to one another without the modems.
        It is also used to serially connect a computer to a printer, since
        both are DTE, and is known as a Printer Cable.


    OFDMA
        TBD


    OPDS
    Open Publication Distribution System
        The `Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPDS>`_ is a way for electronic book
        reading devices to access catalogs of books and download books itself
        from a web server. Its specification is prepared by an informal grouping
        of partners, combining Internet Archive, O'Reilly Media, Feedbooks, OLPC,
        and others.

    PDU
    Power Distribution Unit
        A `power distribution unit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distribution_unit>`_
        (PDU) or mains distribution unit (MDU) is a device fitted with multiple
        (outputs designed to distribute electric power, especially to racks of
        (computers and networking equipment located within a data center. Data
        (centers face challenges in power protection and management solutions.
        (This is why many data centers rely on PDU monitoring to improve
        (efficiency, uptime, and growth.

    PEM

        `Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Enhanced_Mail>`_ is a 1993
        :term:`IETF` proposal for securing email using public-key
        cryptography. Although PEM became an IETF proposed standard it was
        never widely deployed or used.


    PEM Encoded

        Base64 encoded binary data, often used to store :term:`X.509`
        certificates and keys usually enclosed between  "-----BEGIN
        CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" strings.


    POP
    POP3
        The `Post Office Protocol (POP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP3>`_
        is an Internet protocol used by mail clients to retrieve mail from
        remote servers over a TCP/IP connection. POP has been developed through
        several versions, with version 3 (**POP3**) being the current standard.

    RC4

        `RC4 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4>`_ is the most widely used
        software stream cipher and  is used in popular protocols such as
        Transport Layer Security (TLS) and  WEP (to secure wireless networks).
        While remarkable for its simplicity and speed in software, RC4 has
        weaknesses that argue against its use in new systems. As of 2013, there
        is speculation that some state cryptologic agencies may possess the
        capability to break RC4 even when used in the TLS protocol.
        **RC4 should disabled and avoided wherever possible!**

    Regular Expression
    regex
    regexp
        A `regular expression <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>`_,
        regex or regexp is a sequence of characters that define a search
        pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms
        for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input
        validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science
        and formal language theory.

    RFC
    Request for Comments
        A `Request for Comments (RFC)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments>`_ is a publication of the
        :term:`Internet Engineering Task Force` (:term:`IETF`) and the Internet
        Society, the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for
        the Internet.


    ROM
    Read-Only Memory

        Read-only memory (ROM) is a class of storage medium used in computers
        and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified
        slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to
        distribute :term:`Firmware`.


    RSA
        `RSA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29>`_ is one of
        the first practicable public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for
        secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is
        public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. RSA
        stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who first
        publicly described the algorithm in 1977. Youtube has `this video
        <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8>`_ that explains it in 16
        minutes.


    RTS/CTS Threshold
        RTS (Request to send) and CTS (Clear to Send) is the optional mechanism
        used by the :term:`802.11` wireless networking protocol to reduce frame
        collisions introduced by the "hidden node problem". Originally the
        protocol fixed the "exposed node problem" as well, but modern RTS/CTS
        includes ACKs and does not solve the exposed node problem.

        RTS (Request to send) is send by the client to the access point – it
        essentially asks for permission to send the next data packet. The lower
        the threshold, the more stable your Wi-Fi network, since it essentially
        asks more often when sending packages. However, if you don’t have
        problems with your Wi-Fi you should make sure that the RTS Threshold is
        set to the maximum allowed.

    RS-232

        In telecommunications, `RS-232
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232>`_, Recommended Standard 232
        refers to a standard originally introduced in 1960 for serial
        communication transmission of data. It formally defines signals
        connecting between a DTE (data terminal equipment) such as a computer
        terminal, and a DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment or data
        communication equipment), such as a modem. The standard defines the
        electrical characteristics and timing of signals, the meaning of
        signals, and the physical size and pinout of connectors.

        See also :term:`Serial Port`.

    Salt
        In cryptography, a `salt
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29>`_ is random data
        that is used as an additional input to a :term:`Cryptographic Hash
        Function` on a password or passphrase. The primary function of salts is
        to defend against dictionary attacks versus a list of password hashes
        and against pre- computed :term:`Rainbow Table` attacks. A new salt is
        randomly generated for each password. In a typical setting, the salt and
        the password are concatenated and processed with a :term:`Cryptographic
        Hash Function`, and the resulting output (but not the original password)
        is stored with the salt in a database. Hashing allows for later
        authentication while defending against compromise of the plaintext
        password in the event that the database is somehow compromised.
        Cryptographic salts are broadly used in many modern computer systems,
        from Unix system credentials to Internet security.


    Serial Port
    COM Port

        In computing, a serial port is a serial communication interface
        through which information transfers in or out one bit at a time (in
        contrast to a parallel port).Throughout most of the history of
        personal computers, data was transferred through serial ports to
        devices such as modems, terminals, and various peripherals.

        While such interfaces as Ethernet, FireWire, and USB all send data as
        a serial stream, the term serial port usually identifies hardware
        compliant to the :term:`RS-232` standard or similar and intended to
        interface with a modem or with a similar communication device.

        Modern computers without serial ports may require USB-to-serial
        converters to allow compatibility with RS-232 serial devices. Serial
        ports are still used in applications such as industrial automation
        systems, scientific instruments, point of sale systems and some
        industrial and consumer products. Server computers may use a serial
        port as a control console for diagnostics. Network equipment (such as
        routers and switches) often use serial console for configuration.
        Serial ports are still used in these areas as they are simple, cheap
        and their console functions are highly standardized and widespread. A
        serial port requires very little supporting software from the host
        system.

        On personal computers they are called **COM** ports and numerated like
        COM1, COM2 etc.


    Short Preamble
    Long Preamble
        Preamble Type is an easy router option that can boost the performance of
        your wireless wifi network slightly. Most of the routers or firmware has
        the default setting for the Preamble Type as long.

        Preamble Type setting means that it adds some additional data header
        strings to help check the wifi data transmission errors. Short Preamble
        Type uses shorter data strings that adds less data to transmit the error
        redundancy check which means that it is much faster. Long Preamble Type
        uses longer data strings which allow for better error checking
        capability.

    SHA
    SHA1
    SHA-1

        `SHA-1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1>`_ is a :term:`Cryptographic
        Hash Function` designed by the NSA and is a U.S. Governement Standard
        published by the United States NIST in 1995. SHA stands for "secure hash
        algorithm". In 2005, analysts found attacks on SHA-1 suggesting
        that the algorithm might not be secure enough for ongoing use. The U.S,
        the German and other governements are required to move to SHA-2 after
        2010 because of the weakness. Windows will stop accepting SHA-1
        certificates by 2017. Hoever a large part of todays commercial
        certificate authorities still only issue SHA-1 signed certificates.

        SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) is the latest member of the Secure Hash
        Algorithm family of standards, released by NIST on August 5, 2015.
        Although part of the same series of standards, SHA-3 is internally
        different from the MD5-like structure of :term:`SHA-1` and
        :term:`SHA-2`.

        SHA-3 is a subset of the broader cryptographic primitive family Keccak
        designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michaël Peeters, and Gilles Van
        Assche, building upon RadioGatún. Keccak's authors have proposed
        additional uses for the function, not (yet) standardized by NIST,
        including a stream cipher, an authenticated encryption system, a "tree"
        hashing scheme for faster hashing on certain architectures, and AEAD
        ciphers Keyak and Ketje.

        Keccak is based on a novel approach called sponge construction. Sponge
        construction is based on a wide random function or random permutation,
        and allows inputting ("absorbing" in sponge terminology) any amount of
        data, and outputting ("squeezing") any amount of data, while acting as a
        pseudorandom function with regard to all previous inputs. This leads to
        great flexibility.

        NIST does not currently plan to withdraw SHA-2 or remove it from the
        revised Secure Hash Standard. The purpose of SHA-3 is that it can be
        directly substituted for SHA-2 in current applications if necessary, and
        to significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm
        toolkit.


    Sieve
        `Sieve <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_%28mail_filtering_language%29>`_
        is a programming language that can be used to create filters for email.
        Sieve's base specification is outlined in :rfc:`5228`.




    SMTP
        The `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP>`_ is the protool used by a
        :term:`MTA` to transmit mails between Internet domains. First defined
        by :rfc:`821` in 1982, it was last updated in 2008 as :term:`ESMTP`.
        SMTP by default uses TCP port 25. SMTP connections secured by SSL, known
        as :term:`SMTPS`, default to TCP port 465.


    SMTPS
        `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTPS>`_ was a way to provide
        :term:`SSL` secured :term:`SMTP` connections on TCP port 465. SMTPS
        has been revoked in favor of :term:`Submission` in 1998 and today TCP
        port 465 is reserved for other purposes. Nonetheless many mail service
        providers still provide this service on port 465 today.


    SPF
    Sender Policy Framework

        `Sender Policy Framework <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework>`_
        (SPF) is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender
        addresses during the delivery of the email. SPF alone though is limited
        only to detect a forged sender claimed in the envelope of the mail which
        is used when the mail gets bounced. Only in combination with
        :term:`DMARC` it can be used to detect forging of the visible sender in
        emails (email spoofing), a technique often used in phishing and email
        spam.

        SPF allows the receiving mail server to check during mail delivery that
        a mail claiming to come from a specific domain is submitted by an IP
        address authorized by that domain's administrators. The list of
        authorized sending hosts and IP addresses for a domain is published in
        the DNS records for that domain.

        Sender Policy Framework is defined in :rfc:`7208` dated April 2014 as a
        "proposed standard".

    SSH

        `Secure Shell (SSH) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell>`_ is a
        cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely
        over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote
        command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network
        service can be secured with SSH.

    SSID
    Service Set Identifier
        In :term:`IEEE 802.11` wireless local area networking standards
        (including Wi-Fi), a
        `service set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)>`_
        is a group of wireless network devices
        that are operating with the same networking parameters.

        The SSID or "Service Set Identifier" is a unique ID of up to 32
        characters that is used for naming wireless networks. When
        multiple wireless networks overlap in a certain location, SSIDs make
        sure that data gets sent to the correct destination.

        Each packet sent over a wireless network includes the SSID, which
        ensures that the data being sent over the air arrives at the correct
        location.

        See also :term:`BSSID`.


    SSL
    Secure Sockets Layer

        Secure Sockets Layer is the predecessor of :term:`Transport Layer
        Security` (:term:`TLS`).


    STARTTLS
    Opportunistic TLS
        `Opportunistic TLS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS>`_
        (Transport Layer Security) refers to extensions in plain text
        communication protocols, which offer a way to upgrade a plain text
        connection to an encrypted (:term:`TLS` or SSL) connection instead of
        using a separate port for encrypted communication. Several protocols
        use a command named "STARTTLS" for this purpose. It is primarily
        intended as a countermeasure to passive monitoring.
        The STARTTLS command for :term:`IMAP` and :term:`POP3` is defined in
        :rfc:`2595`, for :term:`SMTP` in :rfc:`3207`, for :term:`XMPP` in
        :rfc:`6120` and for :term:`NNTP` in :rfc:`4642`. For :term:`IRC`, the
        IRCv3 Working Group has defined the STARTTLS extension. :term:`FTP`
        uses the command "AUTH TLS" defined in :rfc:`4217` and :term:`LDAP`
        defines a protocol extension OID in :rfc:`2830`. :term:`HTTP` uses
        upgrade header.


    Stock ROM
        Original :term:`Firmware` of a device as supplied by the manufacturer on
        a programmable :term:`ROM`. The term is mostly used in the context where
        a third party provides alternative :term:`Firmware` which may enhance or
        otherwise change the functionality of a device, beyond the intentions of
        its original manufacturer.


    Submission
        Message Submission for Mail is a protocol defined in :rfc:`6409` and
        used by mail clients (:term:`MSA`, :term:`MUA`) to submit electronic
        mail for further delivery on the internet. It is essentially
        :term:`SMTP`, but with mandatory :term:`TLS`-encrpytion and user
        authentication added and running on TCP port 587.


    TKIP
    Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
        `Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_Key_Integrity_Protocol>` is a
        security protocol used in the :term:`IEEE 802.11` wireless networking
        standard. TKIP was designed by the :term:`IEEE 802.11i` task group and
        the Wi-Fi Alliance as an interim solution to replace :term:`WEP` without
        requiring the replacement of legacy hardware. This was necessary because
        the breaking of WEP had left Wi-Fi networks without viable link-layer
        security, and a solution was required for already deployed hardware.
        However, TKIP itself is no longer considered secure, and was deprecated
        in the 2012 revision of the 802.11 standard.


    TLDR
    TL;DR
        "Too Long; Didn't Read".


    TLS
    Transport Layer Security

        Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, :term:`Secure Sockets
        Layer` (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to  provide communication
        security over the Internet. They use :term:`X.509` certificates and hence
        asymmetric cryptography to authenticate the counterparty with whom they are
        communicating, and to exchange a symmetric key. This session key is then used
        to encrypt data flowing between the parties. This allows for data/message
        confidentiality, and message authentication codes for message integrity and as
        a by-product, message authentication.


    TLSA
        A TLSA DNS record publishes information on certificates used by a
        :term:`TLS` secured server. Clients (e.g webbrowsers) can verify the TLS
        certificate of a server by checking the TLSA DNS record instead of or
        additionally to check if the certificates is singned by a trusted
        certificate authority. TLSA is part of the :term:`DANE` specfication.
        Domains publishing TLSA records must be secured by :term:`DNSSEC`.


    TOFU

        `Trust on first use (TOFU) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use>`_,
        or trust upon first use (TUFU), is a security model used by client
        software which needs to establish a trust relationship with an
        unknown or not-yet-trusted endpoint. In a TOFU model, the client will
        try to look up the identifier, usually some kind of public key, in
        its local trust database. If no identifier exists yet for the
        endpoint, the client software will either prompt the user to
        determine if the client should trust the identifier or it will simply
        trust the identifier which was given and record the trust
        relationship into its trust database. If a different identifier is
        received in subsequent connections to the endpoint the client
        software will consider it to be untrusted.

        The TOFU approach can be used when connecting to arbitrary or unknown
        endpoints which do not have a trusted third party such as a
        certificate authority. For example, the :term:`SSH` protocol is
        designed to issue a prompt the first time the client connects to an
        unknown or not-yet-trusted endpoint. Other implementations of TOFU can
        be found in :term:`HTTP Public Key Pinning` in which browsers will
        always accept the first public key returned by the server and with
        :term:`HTTP Strict Transport Security` in which browsers will obey the
        redirection rule for the duration of 'age' directive.


    Twofish

        In cryptography, `Twofish <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twofish>`_ is a
        symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key sizes
        up to 256 bits. It was one of the five finalists of the Advanced
        Encryption Standard contest, but it was not selected for
        standardization. Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher
        :term:`Blowfish`.

    WEP
    Wired Equivalent Privacy

        `Wired Equivalent Privacy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy>`_
        (WEP) is a security algorithm for :term:`IEEE 802.11` wireless networks.
        Introduced as part of the original 802.11 standard ratified in 1997, its
        intention was to provide data confidentiality comparable to that of a
        traditional wired network.

        WEP, recognizable by its key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits (40 or 104
        bits), was at one time widely in use and was often the first security
        choice presented to users by router configuration tools.

        In 2003 the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP had been superseded by
        :term:`Wi-Fi Protected Access` (WPA). In 2004, with the ratification of
        the full 802.11i standard (i.e. :term:`WPA2`), the :term:`IEEE` declared
        that both WEP-40 and WEP-104 have been deprecated.

        WEP was the only encryption protocol available to :term:`802.11a` and
        :term:`802.11b` devices built before the WPA standard, which was
        available for :term:`802.11g` devices. However, some 802.11b devices
        were later provided with firmware or software updates to enable WPA, and
        newer devices had it built in.

    Wireless Multimedia Extensions
    WME
    WMM
        `Wireless Multimedia Extensions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Multimedia_Extensions>`_
        (WME), also known as Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM), is a Wi-Fi Alliance
        interoperability certification, based on the :term:`IEEE 802.11e` standard. It
        provides basic :term:`Quality of Service` (QoS) features to :term:`IEEE 802.11`
        networks. WMM prioritizes traffic according to four Access Categories
        (AC): voice (AC_VO), video (AC_VI), best effort (AC_BE), and background
        (AC_BK). However, it does not provide guaranteed throughput. It is
        suitable for well-defined applications that require QoS, such as :term:`Voice
        over IP` (VoIP) on Wi-Fi phones (:term:`VoWLAN`).

        WMM is mandatory for :term:`802.11n`. If you disable WMM you also
        disable 802.11n and your wirelless network will automatically fall
        back to :term:`802.11g`


    WLAN
        TBD


    WLAN Channel
    Wireless LAN Channel
    Wireless Local Area Network Channel

        Wireless local area network channels using :term:`IEEE 802.11`
        protocols are sold mostly under the trademark WiFi.

        The 802.11 workgroup has documented use in five distinct frequency
        ranges: 2.4 GHz, 3.6 GHz, 4.9 GHz, 5 GHz, and 5.9 GHz bands. Each
        range is divided into a multitude of channels. Countries apply their
        own regulations to the allowable channels, allowed users and maximum
        power levels within these frequency ranges.

        A `List of WLAN Channels <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels>`_
        is available at Wikipedia.

    WPA
    Wi-Fi Protected Access
    IEEE 802.11i
        `Wi-Fi Protected Access <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access>`_
        is a security certification programs developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to
        secure wireless computer networks. The Alliance defined these in
        response to serious weaknesses researchers had found in the previous
        system, Wired Equivalent Privacy (:term:`WEP`).

        WPA (sometimes referred to as the draft IEEE 802.11i standard) became
        available in 2003. The Wi-Fi Alliance intended it as an intermediate
        measure in anticipation of the availability of the more secure and
        complex :term:`WPA2`, which became available in 2004 and is a common
        shorthand for the full IEEE 802.11i (or :term:`IEEE 802.11i-2004`)
        standard.

        In January 2018, Wi-Fi Alliance announced the release of :term:`WPA3`
        with several security improvements over WPA2.


    WPA2
    Wi-Fi Protected Access II
    IEEE 802.11i-2004
        `IEEE 802.11i-2004 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004>`_,
        or 802.11i for short, is an amendment to the original IEEE 802.11,
        implemented as Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2). The draft standard was
        ratified on 24 June 2004. This standard specifies security mechanisms
        for wireless networks, replacing the short Authentication and privacy
        clause of the original standard with a detailed Security clause. In the
        process, the amendment deprecated broken Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP),
        while it was later incorporated into the published IEEE 802.11-2007
        standard.

    WPA2-PSK
        A :term:`WPA2` wireless connection using the a pre-shared key (aka a
        password) to carry out the initial authentication process.

    WPA3
        In January 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced WPA3 as a replacement to
        :term:`WPA2`. The new standard uses 128-bit encryption in WPA3-Personal
        mode (192-bit in WPA3-Enterprise) and :term:`Forward Secrecy`. The WPA3
        standard also replaces the Pre-Shared Key exchange with Simultaneous
        Authentication of Equals as defined in IEEE 802.11-2016 resulting in a
        more secure initial key exchange in personal mode. The Wi-Fi Alliance
        also claims that WPA3 will mitigate security issues posed by weak
        passwords and simplify the process of setting up devices with no display
        interface.

    WPS
    Wi-Fi Protected Setup

        Originally called, Wi-Fi Simple Config,
        `WiFi Protected Setup <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup>`_
        is a network security standard to create a secure wireless home network.

        Created by the Wi-Fi Alliance and introduced in 2006, the goal of the
        protocol is to allow home users who know little of wireless security
        and may be intimidated by the available security options to set up Wi-
        Fi Protected Access, as well as making it easy to add new devices to
        an existing network without entering long passphrases. Prior to the
        standard, several competing solutions were developed by different
        vendors to address the same need.

        A major security flaw was revealed in December 2011 that affects
        wireless routers with the WPS PIN feature, which most recent models
        have enabled by default. The flaw allows a remote attacker to recover
        the WPS PIN in a few hours with a brute-force attack and, with the WPS
        PIN, the network's WPA/WPA2 pre-shared key. Users have been urged
        to turn off the WPS PIN feature.

    X.509
        In cryptography, X.509 is an ITU-T standard for a public key
        infrastructure (PKI) and Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI).
        X.509 specifies, amongst other things, standard formats for public key
        certificates, certificate revocation lists, attribute certificates, and
        a certification path validation algorithm.

    XMPP
        `Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmpp>`_  is a communications protocol for
        message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language).
        The protocol was originally named Jabber and was developed by the Jabber
        open-source community in 1999 for near real-time, instant messaging (IM),
        presence information, and contact list maintenance.
