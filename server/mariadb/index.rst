Database Server
===============

`MariaDB <https://mariadb.org/en/>`_ is a community-developed fork of the `MySQL
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL>`_ relational database management system
intended to remain free under the GNU GPL.

Being a fork of a leading open source software system, it is notable for being
led by the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over its
acquisition by Oracle.
